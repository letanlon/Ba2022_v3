# Mixed Reality Remote Maintenance
This is a project I worked on for 3 months as part of my bachelor's thesis. It's a prototype to demonstrate the fundamental idea of MR Remote-Maintenance. This app is one part of the developed system, which also consists of a server and a web frontend to manage the 3D models. This is made for devices of the Windows Mixed Reality Plattform and was successfully tested on HoloLens 2 and HP Reverb G2.
